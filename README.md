## Installation 
 Users can fork this repository and host these files on a local host server, or a cloud server. When running in a local environment, you will need to use node.js running in your preferred source-code editor. Command "node server.js" will start the express server. Navigating to localhost:3000 will load the application in your web browser. 
  
 
## Usage 
 Once the application is running in the web browser, the user can enter titles and text content for notes. Clicking the save button in the upper right corner, the note will be added to the list in the aside section of this notes page. The user can delete the notes with the trash can buttons.
